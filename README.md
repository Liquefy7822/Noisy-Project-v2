# Noisy Project

This project is aimed at helping maintain a quiet environment during O Level practical exams for students. Students designed and developed it for their fellow students appearing for these crucial exams.

The system uses a microphone to detect sound levels in the examination room. If the sound levels exceed a certain threshold, indicating potential noise disturbance, it displays a red light as a visual cue for students to remain quiet. Conversely, when the sound levels are within the acceptable range, it shows a green light, signalling that the environment is appropriately quiet.

The primary purpose of this project is to serve as a gentle reminder for students to maintain silence during the practical examinations, thereby minimizing potential distractions and ensuring a conducive environment for everyone to concentrate and perform their best.
